# GeneticFuzzyExercises

This report is created as part of the Computational Intelligence \& Deep Reinforcement Learning course in Electrical and Computer Engineering department of Aristotle University of Thessaloniki. Analysis of the exercises can be found in the reports (Ga, FL).

The first study investigates the behavior and performance of a Genetic Algorithm (GA) under various configurations and parameter settings, focusing on its convergence properties and schema propagation dynamics. The results provide insights into the stability and convergence behavior of the algorithm, highlighting the impact of selection pressure and genetic diversity introduced through crossover and mutation.
